    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Navin Gunaratnam. I am a student in high school. I reside in Canada. I have been coding for about 3
        months now. I learned python at age 15 from Angela Yu, a skilled coding instructor and Founder of the London App
        Brewery, on Udemy. I have many projects, including a Work-efficiency timer, blackjack game, and a Quiz app. I am
        still young and have a lot ot learn. If you hire me, you will not only help me grow, but help improve the
        experience for many other customers and yourself if you choose to hire me again.

          I am a skilled programmer knowing various coding languages like, Python and HTML. I am able to make games,
          websites , computer applications, and many other useful tools. I can usually complete a project within a week
          to a couple of months depending on the complexity of your request.

      <p>
          I have a love for video games, my main inspiration for becoming a programmer. It is my dream to someday
          work for Nintendo, Game Freak, or Sega. My favourite Game Series are Mario, Pokemon, Zelda, and Sonic.
